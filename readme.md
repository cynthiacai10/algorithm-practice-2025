# Algorithm Practice for Delft APC 2025

This repository is dedicated to daily algorithm practice in preparation for the **Delft Algorithm Programming Contest (DAPC)** on **September 20th, 2025**.


## 🎯 Practice Plan

Our team is called **Recursion Killed The Cat**.

My coach is **Klift**, an AES Hacker, and a cat wizard. My practice buddy is **ej200CE**, a mysterious man who enjoys doing groceries at SPAR. Salute.

Daily commits reflect consistency. Weekly summaries and reflections may be added to track growth and recurring challenges.

## 🧾 Final Note

This journey isn’t just about speed-solving — it’s about building clarity of thought, resilience in debugging, and a team spirit that survives even the trickiest off-by-one errors.

Thanks for visiting this repository. If you’re also grinding toward a contest or just love the beauty of algorithms — happy coding, and may your recursion always hit the base case.

*Let the grind begin — one bug, one AC at a time 🚀*
